Build conversion list of repos to convert


Get list of subdirectories:
$ find . -type d | grep -v ".svn"
.
./plan
./support
./aoc
...

This might be better as it would handle svn repo subdirectories:
$ find . -name svn_ext_val.txt
./tickets/svn_ext_val.txt
./tickets/00COMPLETE/svn_ext_val.txt
./svn_ext_val.txt
...

NOTE: The above does not catch standalone repos with a svn_ext_val.txt
